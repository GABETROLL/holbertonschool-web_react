# Learning React at Holberton
This folder showcases a step-by-step guide on how to build a simple recreation of the Holberton student's dashboard with React, by showcasing a new skill of React in each folder, which adds a new feature to the application.
## Usage
### Install Dependencies
Unfortunately, because of the way this project is structured, you will need to install the dependencies for each individual exercise folder you wish to test:
```
$ cd project_directory/task_N/dashboard/
project_directory/task_N/dashboard $ npm install
```
This is because as the app progresses, more dependencies are needed, so they are listed individually.
### Run Project Folder
